For our Human Centered Robotics course at university we are making a robot that will print unique leaflets/tickets after "making friends" with someone. So we bought a receipt printer for its rapid printing and cutting capabilities.

The "main focus" of the project is the C++ code to print text files and cut.

The sidetracked part of this project is a basic PHP script using twitter to print out the hashtags...

##Raspberry PI
required: PHP-CLI, GCC, GIT, BOOST libraries & receipt printer (we're using NCR 7167).

C recompiled for ARM and running on Raspberry Pi
